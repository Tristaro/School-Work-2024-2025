- **Diegetic Sound Manipulation**: The film constantly alters and removes sound to emphasize the constructed nature of animated cinema. For example, Daffy Duck’s voice sometimes gets erased or mismatched, highlighting his dependence on external creative forces.
    
- **Use of Silence**: There are moments where the background disappears, and silence dominates. This highlights the artificial nature of film sound, reminding the audience of its constructed reality.
    
- **Layered Sound Effects**: The film plays with exaggerated sound effects (e.g., Daffy's sword swipes, gunshots, and out-of-sync audio) to heighten the comedic effect and make the audience aware of the manipulative power of film sound.
    
- **The Role of the Animator’s Voice**: Bugs Bunny, as the unseen animator, represents the ultimate control over the diegetic world. His presence is revealed only through voice and sound, emphasizing the power of the off-screen soundscape in cinema.
