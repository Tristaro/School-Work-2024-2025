# Linear Algebra 1600

A Comprehensive Collection of Notes, Practice, and Resources

This repository contains all my work for the Linear Algebra 1600 class, including notes, practice problems, and supporting materials.

## What's Inside

- **PDF Notes**: Complete and detailed notes with embedded figures and explanations.
- **Markdown Files**: Editable versions of the notes (note that figures are not visible on GitHub).
- **Figures**: Visual aids used in the notes (viewable in the PDF files).

## How to Use

- **View PDFs**: To access the complete notes with all figures, open the PDF files.
- **Markdown Files**: Use these for text-based content and structure, but note that they lack the embedded figures visible in the PDFs.
