OKJA, (2017) dir. Bong Joon-ho • Characters: Mija, Lucy Mirando, Nancy Mirando, Jay, Johnny Wilcox, Hee Bong [Mija's grandfather], • What’s the very basic story in one paragraph? The film is about a young girl who raised a genetically modi fied "super pig" (the titular Okja), and, after she is taken to the United States, goes on a mission to rescue her from mistreatment at the hands of the meat industry.

- **Use value** – Okja’s use value to Mija is as a beloved companion and family member, while the Mirando Corporation sees Okja’s use value as a source of meat.
    
- **Exchange value** – Okja is given an exchange value when the Mirando Corporation commodifies her, measuring her worth in financial terms rather than emotional or ethical considerations.
    
- **Commodity Fetishism** – The packaged super pig meat is distanced from the reality of Okja’s suffering, allowing consumers to engage with the product without recognizing the exploitation behind it.
    
- **Binary opposition** – The film contrasts corporate greed (Mirando Corporation) with innocence and activism (Mija and ALF), illustrating a battle between ethics and capitalism.
    
- **Ideological Codes** – The film critiques the capitalist ideology that prioritizes profit over ethics, sustainability, and animal welfare, exposing how corporate marketing manipulates public perception.
    
- **Denotation** – On the surface, the film is about a girl trying to save her pet.
    
- **Connotation** – Deeper themes include critiques of capitalism, industrialization, ethical consumption, and corporate deception.
    
- **Cyborg** – Okja, though not a cyborg, represents a genetically modified hybrid, blurring the lines between nature and artificial creation, much like cyborgs in other narratives.
    
- **Capitalism** – The Mirando Corporation epitomizes capitalist excess, exploiting animals and workers for maximum profit while using marketing to maintain a socially responsible image.
    
- **Commons** – The film suggests that nature, animals, and food production should be part of a global commons rather than being privatized for corporate gain.
    
- **Growth becomes a new religion of progress** – Mirando justifies its unethical practices by promoting innovation and progress, ignoring the environmental and ethical consequences.
    
- **Industrial growth and the need to create consumers** – The corporation markets super pigs as the future of meat, manufacturing consumer demand through advertising and propaganda.
    
- **Fordism** – The mass production of super pigs mirrors Fordist principles, with efficiency, standardization, and assembly-line production applied to living beings.
    
- **Mass production** – Okja is one of many genetically engineered pigs designed for large-scale meat production, reflecting how industrialized farming operates.
    
- **Assembly line** – The slaughterhouse scenes depict a literal assembly line of death, where super pigs are processed in a highly mechanized, impersonal system.
    
- **Scientific Management** – The Mirando Corporation applies Taylorist principles to farming, optimizing efficiency at the cost of ethical considerations.
    
- **Division of labour** – The meat industry workers have specialized roles, from handling the animals to running the slaughterhouse machinery, much like a factory.
    
- **Rationality and Weber** – The corporation operates under Weberian rationality, emphasizing efficiency, predictability, and calculability, even when it leads to moral and environmental harm.
    
- **Bureaucracy** – The Mirando Corporation is structured as a hierarchical bureaucracy, with rigid control over production, marketing, and decision-making.
    
- **‘The one best way’** – The company presents its genetically modified super pigs as the best solution to global food shortages, ignoring ethical and ecological alternatives.
    
- **Irrationality and the ‘Iron Cage’** – The meat industry’s obsession with efficiency leads to irrational outcomes, such as immense cruelty and environmental destruction, trapping both workers and consumers in an inhumane system.
