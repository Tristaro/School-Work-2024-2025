# OKJA (2017) - Directed by Bong Joon-ho

## **Plot Summary**
The film is about a young girl, Mija, who raised a genetically modified "super pig" (the titular Okja). When Okja is taken to the United States, Mija embarks on a mission to rescue her from mistreatment at the hands of the meat industry.

## **Key Concepts and How They Apply to Okja**

### **Economic and Sociological Themes**
- **Use value** – Okja’s use value to Mija is as a beloved companion and family member, while the Mirando Corporation sees Okja’s use value as a source of meat.
- **Exchange value** – Okja is commodified, given an exchange value when the Mirando Corporation evaluates her in financial terms.
- **Commodity Fetishism** – The packaged super pig meat is distanced from Okja’s suffering, allowing consumers to ignore the exploitation behind the product.
- **Binary opposition** – The film contrasts corporate greed (Mirando Corporation) with innocence and activism (Mija and ALF), illustrating a battle between ethics and capitalism.
- **Ideological Codes** – The film critiques capitalist ideology, revealing how corporations manipulate public perception for profit.
- **Denotation** – On the surface, the film is about a girl trying to save her pet.
- **Connotation** – The deeper themes include critiques of capitalism, industrialization, ethical consumption, and corporate deception.

### **Industrialization and Capitalism**
- **Cyborg** – While Okja is not a cyborg, she represents a genetically modified hybrid, blurring the lines between nature and artificial creation.
- **Capitalism** – The Mirando Corporation epitomizes capitalist excess, exploiting animals and workers for maximum profit.
- **Commons** – The film suggests that nature, animals, and food production should be a global commons rather than being privatized for corporate gain.
- **Growth becomes a new religion of progress** – Mirando justifies its unethical practices by promoting innovation and progress.
- **Industrial growth and the need to create consumers** – The corporation manufactures consumer demand for super pig meat through advertising and propaganda.

### **Mass Production and Efficiency**
- **Fordism** – The mass production of super pigs mirrors Fordist principles, emphasizing efficiency, standardization, and assembly-line production.
- **Mass production** – Okja is one of many genetically engineered pigs designed for large-scale meat production, reflecting industrialized farming.
- **Assembly line** – The slaughterhouse scenes depict a literal assembly line of death, where super pigs are processed in a mechanized system.
- **Scientific Management** – The Mirando Corporation applies Taylorist principles to farming, optimizing efficiency at the cost of ethics.
- **Division of labour** – The meat industry workers specialize in handling animals or running slaughterhouse machinery, much like a factory.

### **Bureaucracy and Rationalization**
- **Rationality and Weber** – The corporation operates under Weberian rationality, prioritizing efficiency, predictability, and calculability.
- **Bureaucracy** – The Mirando Corporation is structured hierarchically, with strict control over production, marketing, and operations.
- **‘The one best way’** – The company presents genetically modified super pigs as the ultimate food solution, disregarding ethical alternatives.
- **Irrationality and the ‘Iron Cage’** – The meat industry’s pursuit of efficiency leads to cruelty and environmental destruction, trapping both workers and consumers in an inhumane system.
